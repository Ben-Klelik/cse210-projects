# cse210-student-template
The base of the projects stored in this repository are templates created with starter code for students in CSE 210. 

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `final` - Starter projects for final project.

The details of my work with each project will be added to the lines below.

* `prep 1` is boring
* `prep 2` is a silly 6 liner for grade letter calculation
* `prep 3` is guess the number game
* `prep 4` give list of numbers and then compute average, sum, etc.
* `prep 5` static function usage
